# Storytelling-Data-Visualization-
This project explores the dynamics of the US dollar against the euro using data sourced from the European Central Bank. The analysis focuses on key events that have influenced the exchange rate between the two currencies, including the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the leadership of the last three US presidents: Bush, Obama, and Trump.

Through comprehensive data visualization and explanatory data analysis, this repository showcases the trends and patterns in the dollar-euro exchange rate over time. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, the project provides insights into how economic, political, and global factors impact currency fluctuations.

Additionally, the project narrative encompasses a storytelling aspect, highlighting the significance of each event and its implications on the exchange rate. This storytelling approach enhances understanding and engagement, making complex economic concepts more accessible to a broader audience.
